This project aims to build a direct conversion receiver using the Hartley demodulator and an FPGA. When all is finished we should have a receiver capable of:

  * 0-50MHz Bandwidth
  * AM
  * Upper and Lower side bands
  * Continuous Wave
  * FM
  * Fourier Transform on a Display
  * Audio on Speakers
